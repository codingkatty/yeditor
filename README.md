## What is Yeditor? ❓
Yeditor is a website that can edit markdown files. It has several functions and it could help make README writing more effiecient and easier. I made this because I need a markdown editor for my readme, in which I just decided to make one myself.

## Features ✨
- **Easy Image Upload**
Images can be uploaded easily with a simple drag and drop. The image will be hosted and it will show up at the type cursor.

- **Dual Editor**
Besides the text editor, the preview part could also be typed in, also syncronized with the other part.

- **AI Enchance**
> This feature is still developing. It might not function as expected, but feel free to test out!
By clicking on the AI button, the markdown is sent to Gemini. It can make the markdown better, fixing typos and making content easier to understand.

- **Export Options**
There are many ways to export, such as: download as PDF, download as MD and copy to clipboard.
